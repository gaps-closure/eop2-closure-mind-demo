# Send Config Example Application

The `SendConfig` example application sends data from an OrionUi configuration file to a gimbal

## Theory of Operation

`SendConfig` reads from a configuration file specified on the command line and populates a list of packets to send to the gimbal. It will resend each of the packets to the gimbal up to 5 times until it receives the expected response from the gimbal. On exit, it will print a list of gimbal packet IDs that failed to send.

## Command-line Parameters

The application takes several optional arguments, which are ordered and have defaults as follows:

* __Serial Port__: Serial port connected to gimbal – omit to connect via Ethernet.
* __IP Address__: Known IP address for Ethernet connection – omit to attempt to auto-detect.
* __Config File Path__: Path to a .orionconfig file generated by OrionUi
