* fix conflict_analyzer bugs in export of artifact.json and topology.json 
* generate CLOSURE docker image with fixes and updated GEDL heuristics

* fix bb to use websrv not demoapp
* update bb to also build both partitioned and unpartitioned versions (may need to check in partitioned version ?)

* browser must move map with gps 
* webserver must send commands to gimbal


* update Makefile.mbig and Makefile.demoapp to  build the partioned executables
* if needed cleanup code (remove unused macro blocks) so divvied output compiles cleanly
* test with HAL on x86

* develop and integrate xdcomms DMA version
* test e2e on zcu102

* remaining project files to fix
  - Makefile.websrv: untested
  - Makefile.mbig: derived from secdesk, rename to Makefile.websrv and modify for websrv
  - clean.list: should match Dockerfile apt get for this project
  - debs.list: should be empty
  - Makefile.verifier: derived from secdesk, rename to Makefile.websrv and modify for websrv
  - tasks.json: do we want to run verifier and emu?
